-------Overview of the Project------

Project: HEALTH MONITORING WEARABLE DEVICE

Description: Creating a health monitoring station using IoT devices like Arduino and sensors is a fascinating project that can provide real-time health data. 

Components

Arduino Board: The central unit that processes data from various sensors.

Sensors:

Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35): Measures body temperature.
Heart Rate Sensor (e.g., Pulse Sensor): Monitors heart rate.
Blood Pressure Sensor: Measures blood pressure.
Oxygen Saturation Sensor (e.g., MAX30100): Measures blood oxygen levels.

Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266): Connects the Arduino to the internet for data transmission.

IoT Platform (e.g., ThingSpeak): Stores and visualizes the collected data.

Tinkercad: Used for designing and simulating the circuit before actual implementation.
