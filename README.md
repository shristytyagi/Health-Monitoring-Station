-------Overview of the Project------

Project: HEALTH MONITORING WEARABLE DEVICE

Description: Creating a health monitoring station using IoT devices like Arduino and sensors is a fascinating project that can provide real-time health data. 

Components:-

1.Arduino Board: The central unit that processes data from various sensors.

2.Sensors:

Temperature Sensor (e.g., LM35): Measures body temperature.
Heart Rate Sensor (e.g., Pulse Sensor): Monitors heart rate.
Blood Pressure Sensor: Measures blood pressure.
Oxygen Saturation Sensor (e.g., MAX30100): Measures blood oxygen levels.

3.Wi-Fi Module (e.g., ESP8266): Connects the Arduino to the internet for data transmission.

4.IoT Platform (e.g., ThingSpeak): Stores and visualizes the collected data.


Functionality:-

Data Collection:

Temperature Sensor: Measures body temperature and sends the data to the Arduino.
Heart Rate Sensor: Detects the pulse and sends heart rate data to the Arduino.
Blood Pressure Sensor: Measures systolic and diastolic pressure and sends the data to the Arduino.
Oxygen Saturation Sensor: Measures the oxygen level in the blood and sends the data to the Arduino.

Data Processing:

The Arduino processes the data received from all the sensors.
It formats the data for transmission.

Data Transmission:

The Wi-Fi module sends the processed data to an IoT platform like ThingSpeak.

Data Visualization:

The IoT platform displays the data in real-time.
Users can access this data remotely through a web interface or a mobile app.

Tinkercad: Used for designing and simulating the circuit before actual implementation.
